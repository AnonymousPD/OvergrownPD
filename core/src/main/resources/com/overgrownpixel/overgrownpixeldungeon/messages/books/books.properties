books.lorebooks.booksproutingnature.title=Sprouting Nature
books.lorebooks.booksproutingnature.authour=Phenex Monsu
books.lorebooks.booksproutingnature.desc=Living plants are some pretty amazing that populate the dungeon I live in. They are some mutations of plants that are sentient and can move on their own. They are pretty dangerous as they attack anyone aside from other plants. The nature of those mutations are unknown, but I suspect that it has something to do with the magical energy that this specific dungeon has, since it makes grass grow into plants and so it makes sense it would also make them living. In a pinch they can gain nutrients from other plants, powering themselves up. The best strategy to deal with them, from what I could gather from the other dungeon citizens, is to defeat them before they can use their powerful attacks to kill you. I heard that they can also grow on weapons to power them up but so far every known way to do that here in demon halls has failed.
